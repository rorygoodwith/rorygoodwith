## Hi, I'm Rory

I'm currently a Behavioural Data Scientist at Good With, a startup focused on improving financial wellbeing in young adults. I was previously a researcher in psychology based at the University of Plymouth, UK.

I mostly maintain private repos relating to my work at Good With, but I also host a couple of public projects here.
